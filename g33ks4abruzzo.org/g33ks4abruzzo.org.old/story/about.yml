  <p>When tragedy strikes, we often feel helpless. <em>What can we do?</em> we wonder. Sure, we can donate money, but to who? And how much of a difference can our single donation really make? This is how we felt when we saw the tragic earthquake strike Italy recently.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of simply making a donation, though, we decided to create this Web site. All the donations go directly (literally, we take you to the target charity's site in an iframe, so we never see the transaction) to the victims of the tragedy. </p>
  <p>Not only do we make it easy to donate, but then you can also let all your Facebook friends or Twitter followers know that you gave and why. This makes it easy to spread the word and magnify the impact of your donation.</p>
