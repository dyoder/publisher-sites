content: <p>I've mostly gotten my house in order, and so I will be updating this site again eventually.  In the mean time, I've got coding to do, at work and at home, and some additional personal business to conclude.  I don't like to throw this kind of entry up on a blog, but I also don't want to look like I'm dead, so it's a toss-up.  The main selling point was that I could say "back from the deadly".  Bonus points if you can remember that guy without the aid of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22back+from+the+deadly%22">Google</a></p>
summary: Seriously, I'm not dead, just dead tired.
