  <h2>LiveConsole 0.2.0 Released</h2>
  <p>Hey, uh, here's a long-overdue new release of LiveConsole.  If you've
  never heard of it, it is a library for providing IRB over a TCP or Unix
  socket so that you can interact with a running application.  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Unix Domain Socket support (Works under Linux and OS X, apparently; not likely to work under Windows)</li>
  <li>The ability to supply bindings to LiveConsole </li>
  <li>A program for interacting with the Unix socket (installed in your bin directory as udscat), as some versions of netcat don't include this functionality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's useful for debugging, for hot-patching code that you don't want to
  interrupt, for interactive monitoring, and for looking cool.</p>
  
  <h3>For the impatient:</h3>
  <pre>
  	# Run a LiveConsole with IRB bound to the toplevel:
  	lc = LiveConsole.new :socket, :port =&gt; 30303
  	lc.start
  
  	# Fire up a second terminal, and 
  	you@your-box:~$ netcat localhost 30303
  	irb(main):001:0&gt; puts &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
  
  	# This shows up in the terminal of the program that created the
  	# LiveConsole:
  	Hello, world!
  
  	# Run a LiveConsole for the current process, and pass it the
  	# local binding (Unix only):
  	lc = LiveConsole.new :unix_socket, :path =&gt; '/tmp/live-console.sock',
  	                     :bind =&gt; binding
  	lc.start
  
  	# Fire up a second terminal, and 
  	you@your-box:~$ udscat /tmp/live-console.sock
  	irb(main):001:0&gt; puts &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
  
  	# Similar results.  See the example code or the README for
  	# details.
