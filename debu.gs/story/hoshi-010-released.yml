  <p>You can check it out at github right now (<a
  	href="http://github.com/pete/hoshi">http://github.com/pete/hoshi</a>), or
  you can wait for the official release, but Hoshi is here, and it's incredible.
  It's everything you've ever wanted and more.  It's...well, actually it's just
  a first-class view library.</p>
  
  <p><a href="/hoshi">Hoshi</a> fills a gap in Ruby MVC applications, namely the
  V part.  Templates don't count as first-class views, don't allow you to take
  advantage of Ruby's fancy object system (Inheritance is back again!) and
  mixing languages is annoying and makes validation/syntax checking harder.
  With <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> and <a
  	href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/index.html">ERB</a>, you
  are mixing Ruby and HTML and in most cases, also CSS and Javascript, not to
  mention that the templating engine has its own syntactical rules.  On top of
  that, with HAML you don't know if you have valid HTML until you hit the page
  that loads that file, and with ERB you don't know until you run the file, and
  even then it might be valid with some values and invalid with others.  Ouch.</p>
  
  <p>Hoshi solves this problem in a way similar to the way the very clever and
  very cool <a
  	href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/markaby/">Markaby</a> does:  by
  making HTML tags Ruby methods.  The main difference between Hoshi and Markaby
  is that Hoshi::View sub-classes <em>are</em> view objects.  You instantiate
  them, call methods on them, and eventually toss the output of one of these
  methods over to a browser (or whatever).  Hoshi::View isn't a module, there's
  no funny instance_eval or parsetree business going on behind the scenes, and
  method_missing isn't used unless you set the permissive flag in your view.
  And because it guarantees valid HTML/XHTML/XML if you give it valid Ruby,
  you'll know if it's wrong when your code loads, and you can make sure it's
  valid with ruby -c.</p>
  
  
  <p>And there is one more cool piece of functionality provided with Hoshi:
  html2hoshi.  This is a little program (really, a command-line front-end to
  lib/html2hoshi.rb) that takes a big, scary, poorly-indented ball of HTML and
  generates a nice, clean, readable, manageable Ruby file that uses Hoshi to
  generate equivalent HTML.  Want to read some obfuscated or compressed HTML?</p>
  <pre>
  	curl http://www.google.com/ | html2hoshi - | less
  </pre>
  <p>Or maybe you have a web designer that emails you HTML files, and whatever
  WYSIWYG HTML editor he/she uses generates awful, unreadable code.  Maybe the
  disigner where you work generates the unreadable code
  himself/herself<strong>*</strong>.  Either way, your job of cutting up the
  pieces for use in your web app can be a pain.  Well, try this out:</p>
  <pre>
  	html2hoshi index.html index.rb
  </pre>
  <p>I bet that when you do that, you'll feel great.  Now the code is readable,
  and you move chunks around and cut it into pieces like you would any other
  Ruby code.  Wow.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, to summarize, Hoshi:  The Web Can Be Awesome.</p>
  
  <hr />
  <p><strong>*</strong>Web designers reading this:  most of you are cool, please
  don't take this personally, and I'm sure you know the ones I'm talking about.
  But I don't feel that way about you.  You're, like, my BFF.  I've always
  looked up to you and admired your work.  The cleanliness of your purely
  semantic markup, when married to your elegant CSS has often brought tears to
  my eyes.  I'm not talking about <em>your</em> code.  I'm talking about the
  muddled markup manufactured by that guy two cubes down from you.  You know who
  I mean.  The one who has worn down the keys he uses to copy and paste, and who
  always smells oddly like sawdust.</p>
  
  <p>Not that it's a bad smell, just that it's very odd, especially considering
  that he doesn't do any woodworking.  He's got a studio apartment on the third
  floor of that apartment building just down the street from the office, he
  can't possibly own a table saw.  Where would he put it?  But that smell is
  distinctly sawdust.  I mean, I'd ask him about it myself, but honestly, how do
  you bring it up?  And my mind always goes blank when I talk to the guy, you
  know?  All I can think of is sawdust, and it's such a strong scent.  I've
  never smelled actual sawdust that smelled that much like sawdust.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, web designers, to summarize:  We cool?</p>
