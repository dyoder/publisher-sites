  Good news! I've been selected to speak at the "Lone Star RubyConf":http://lonestarrubyconf.com/conference-info in Austin, TX, September 4-6, 2008 on Resource-oriented Web apps using Waves. This will be perfect timing as we expect to have our entire Resource-driven, Layers-based goodness ready for show (also known as the "Turtles All The Way Down release":http://waves.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10707-waves/milestones). Hope to see you there!
  
  I lived in Austin for 12 years before moving to Santa Monica, but I haven't been back since December of '06. So this all seems kinda cosmic.
  
  In other news, another interesting derivative from the Waves project has emerged: "Functor":http://dev.zeraweb.com/introducing-functor. While you're at it, if you find that interesting, "subscribe my personal blog":http://feeds.feedburner.com/MouseTrap20. I tend to post more on the nuts and bolts of the code there. Also, don't forget: "we're on IRC now, too":irc://irc.freenode.net#waves.
  
  We recently pushed a minor update to address some gem compatibility issues (0.7.3) and will soon have a more significant releases (0.7.5 and 0.7.6) with numerous bug fixes, better Windows support, improved request lambdas, and more.
summary: Good news! I've been selected to speak at the LoneStar RubyConf in Austin, TX, September 4-6, 2008 on Resource-oriented Web apps using Waves.
