  h3. What Is Waves?
  
  Today's Web applications must embrace a wide variety of scenarios that don't really fit the Sun MVC paradigm that has dominated Web-based application architecture in the past. Think Ajax, Adobe Air, mashups, OpenID, rich-client mobile apps, and so on.

  Waves helps you meet these challenges by providing a rich DSL for dealing with HTTP instead of trying to hide it from you. Waves Resource classes are faster and more flexible than Rails-style routing. And our mixin approach provides just the architectural magic that your applications need, and nothing more.

  h3.  Try It Out
  
  Waves is currently at version @0.9.3@. (You'll need "gemcutter":gemcutter.)
  
  <pre>
  sudo gem install waves
  waves generate -t classic -n myapp
  cd myapp
  waves server
  </pre>
  
  You can also "run from source":/working-from-source if you like.

  h3. Presentations On Waves
  
  I've given enough talks on Waves now that it seems worthwhile making it easier to find them. Fortunately, "Coby Randquist":http://www.confreaks.com/ has basically been stalking me (or, possibly, vice-versa, hard to say which) and, as a result, all of my talks are available on-line. In order of recent-ness:
