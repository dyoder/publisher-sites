  More good news: we now have version 0.7.7 ("Briareus":http://waves.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10707/milestones/13337-0-7-7-briareus) available as a gem. Kudos to Matthew King, who did the bulk of the work on this release (and the "last one":http://waves.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10707/milestones/12837-0-7-6-eris, which happened so quickly, I never even got a chance to blog about it). This makes three releases in the past month, somewhat making up for the long stretch between 0.7.3 and the next really meaningful release, 0.7.5. Not only that, but we have our new resource-oriented mappings in edge, just waiting to find their way into the world. So you can continue to expect us to keep the pace.
  
  The highlights of this release include:
  
  * ActiveRecord ORM Layer
  * controller ORM dependencies refactored into the appropriate Layers
  * ORM @require@ statements only get called if the ORM is used :)
  * @rake generate:model@ is back
  * @rake waves:freeze@ and @rake waves:unfreeze@
  * Rack:Static filter now picks up /images, /javascript, and /css by default
  * HAML support, via Lawrence Pit
  * You can pass the desired ORM as an argument to the @waves@ command
  
  All in all, another solid release and another step forward.
