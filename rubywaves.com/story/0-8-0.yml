  At long last, we are pushing out a new gem. It has been over 3 months since the last release, but we haven't been idle. If anything, the changes between 0.7.7 and this release (0.8.0) are so dramatic, it consumed our focus and made it difficult to map out a transition path of incremental releases.
  
  So what have we been up to? The biggest change is that the overall focus has shifted from Sun MVC with support for alternative approaches to being much more resource-oriented and architecturally focused. Sun MVC is now basically one way to use Waves, but there is nothing special about it.
  
  What is "resource-oriented"? What this means is that you define your application in terms of resources instead of MVC. HTTP is defined largely in terms of methods that manipulate resources. Waves takes this quite literally and provides a DSL for defining ... well, methods on resources.
  
  There is no "routing," as such, in Waves. It just methods on resources. If Waves gets an HTTP GET request, it calls the @get@ method on whatever resource class represents your application as a whole. This resource may in turn delegate the request to other resources or handle it directly.
  
  In addition to this major shift in focus, there are literally dozens of bug fixes and enhancements. We've added basic caching support, numerous additional helpers for request processing, cleaned up the various layers to avoid loading unnecessary code, and much more.
  
  We're hard at work on new tutorials, screencasts, and so forth, to make it easy to learn and explore Waves. Waves is more and more an architectural playground and so our goal is not to give you formulas for building a blog in ten minutes, but the tools to optimize your architecture for your requirements. Today's applications increasingly must support numerous client platforms and there is no One True Architecture anymore. Waves is there to help you meet that challenge head on.
summary: So what have we been up to? The biggest change is that the overall focus has shifted from Sun MVC with support for alternative approaches to being much more resource-oriented and architecturally focused. Sun MVC is now basically one way to use Waves, but there is nothing special about it.
