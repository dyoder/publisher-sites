  I'm very happy to announce that I'll be speaking on Waves at "GoRuCo":goruco in The Big Apple (specifically, Pace University in Lower Manhattan) on May 31st. I love Manhattan (or, at least, I love visiting there) and I really enjoy these smaller conferences. I wanted to speak at last year's GoRuCo but narrowly missed the deadline because I had been completely immersed in getting the first version of Waves out the door.
  
  I haven't decided if I'm just going to give a variation on the talk I gave at LA RubyConf, or do something a little different. Usually, I like to make each talk different. The advantage is that it keeps the topic fresh, especially since a lot of my previous talks are available on-line anyway. The disadvantage, of course, is that it makes it more difficult to really kill it up there, since I'm always doing it for the first time.
  
  At any rate, I hope you'll register and come to the conference. I think it is a good line-up if I do say so myself. Look forward to seeing you there!
