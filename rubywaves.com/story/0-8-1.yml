  This is mostly a stablization release from the big 0.8.0 release last week. The big improvement is actually the docs, most of which are on this Web site.
  
  We've made a philosophical decision, if you will, to move away from using RDocs as the primary source of documentation for Waves. We will still be using RDocs to document the source, but my (somewhat unpopular belief) is that verbose comments are sometimes at odds with writing readable, easily scanned code. So we try to limit the source comments to those that really clarify something crucial about the code, rather than serving as an exposition for it.
  
  We have collectively put a lot of work into making the code lean and mean and expressive, and I'd rather let it speak for itself as much as possible. Obviously, there will be areas where we've erred on the side of paucity, and I welcome feedback on that score.
  
  Also, what we've done so far is just the start as far as documentation on other support goes. We will be adding more and more on what will probably be a weekly release cycle. Similarly, if you look at the "roadmap":/roadmap you can see that we've outlined a monthly release cycle for Waves as a whole.
  
  We absolutely welcome input on the priorites you see outlined there. Hopefully, it will also give people an idea of where we are going from here. These last two releases are just the start. The past few months have been a bit of an uphill climb as far as stabilizing the core of Waves. However, that is now behind us and Waves now sits on a solid foundation. Now the challenge is to build it out and realize the promise of Ruby-based resource-oriented Web architecture!
  
  A couple of other notes. First, YellowPages.com, which, as many of you know, is my employer, is now officially AT&T Interactive. This is the culmination of a lot of hard work to demonstrate to the Death Star that we can help AT&T create value for consumers beyond just the network.
  
  In particular, within our R&D group, this has been our main focus, so it is nice to be able to talk about it. I say this because we are still looking for elite, creative developers, and Ruby remains our major focus area for agile development. We are doing a lot of very interesting work and Waves is really just the tip of the ice-berg.
  
  Which brings me to "Hoshi":http://github.com/pete/hoshi. Pete Elmore, who also works with me and has been a collaborator on Waves, and I have developed a new library for doing markup (particularly HTML, though that is not an intrinsic limitation of the library) that I am very excited about. 
  
  Pete did most of the work and did a fantastic job, in my opinion, and I am excited about integrating this into Waves. In combination with Matthew King's work on "Cssy":http://github.com/automatthew/cassandra/tree/master, it will take a lot of the pain out of developing Web-based GUIs. (We're still working on the Ajax side of the problem ...) I hope you'll check it out. 
  
  You'll see more exciting work like this coming out of our little band of rogues, so stay tuned! And drop me a line if you'd like to join us! (To those of you who've already contacted me, please be patient, this past couple of weeks was just frantic.)
summary: This is mostly a stablization release from the big 0.8.0 release last week. The big improvement is actually the docs, most of which are on this Web site.
