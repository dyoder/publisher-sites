  Waves is designed to be extended and we "encourage participation.":/contribute However, obviously, that means you will be working off source. So here are some helpful hints on how to do that.
  
  h2. Clone Waves
  
  The first thing is that you'll need to get some facility with "git":http://git.or.cz/gitwiki. Let's start by cloning the Waves repo on GitHub.
  
  <pre>
  git clone git://github.com/dyoder/waves.git
  cd waves
  </pre>
  
  Alright, so far, so good.
  
  h2. Run @rake setup@
  
  If you've installed the gem, it is best at this point to uninstall it:
  
  <pre>
  sudo gem uninstall waves
  </pre>
  
  We've got a nice rake task that will install the gem dependencies for you. If you've installed the gem already, you'll likely be set, but it can't hurt, just in case we've made some changes. If you are using JRuby, we'll automatically detect that.
  
  <pre>
  sudo rake setup
  </pre>
  
  h2. Link To Waves Binary
  
  You'll next want to make sure the waves binary (used for starting the server or console and creating new projects) is available. One way to do this is to simply link to it from /usr/local/bin:
  
  <pre>
  ln -s bin/waves /usr/local/bin/waves
  which waves # should return /usr/local/bin/waves
  </pre>
  
  There are several other alternatives:
  
  * Set the WAVES environment variable to point to your waves source directory.
  * Run Waves from a script in your application directory and set the WAVES global.
  * Copy (or link) the Waves directory into your application directory.
  
  h2. Hack Waves
  
  Yep! You should do it!
  
  After you've added your cool new features, push 'em:
  
  <pre>
  git add .
  git status # check to see if you need to git rm anything ...
  git commit -m "My cool new feature."
  git push origin master
  </pre>
  
  Then send us a pull request by visiting our "repo":http://github.com/dyoder/waves/tree/master and clicking "pull-request."
