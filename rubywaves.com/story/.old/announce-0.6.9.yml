  Well, although there are plenty of interesting things that "remain on the roadmap":/roadmap, the core of the framework is complete and stable. So this will be the last _alpha_ release. The next release will be the 0.7 release and will be the first _beta_ release. I expect to publicly announce during the SuperBowl halftime show right after Tom Petty's done performing.
  
  Kidding.
  
  It will probably be Monday, although I am open to getting last minute feedback and making a few changes before releasing if I think it will significantly improve the "first impression" Waves makes. I am particularly worried about getting contributor support - it is time for Waves to become less of a one-man show and more about the Ruby community itself.
