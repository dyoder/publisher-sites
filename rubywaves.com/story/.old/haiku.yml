  Whew! We thought you might not have been paying attention.
  
  Waves is the collision of an elegant language with the work of "many talented developers":/credits that, together, like piranhas, can strip a cow to the bone in under a minute. Thus, the official Waves Haiku:
  
  <pre>
  piranhas cow do
    strip cow until only? bones
    time? 1.minute ; end
  </pre>
  
  Of course, if you feel inspired by Waves, you should write your own haiku and "post them on the Ruby Waves support forum":http://groups.google.com/group/rubywaves. We will feature the best of them here, where only the most observant will find them.
