  Well, _that_ happened. On consecutive days, Waves was featured on two popular Ruby blogs, "InfoQ":http://www.infoq.com/ruby/ and Peter Cooper's "RubyInside":http://www.rubyinside.com/. It was fantastic exposure and a great way to cap of Waves' first month since it's public launch.
  
  Here are the links:
  
  * "InfoQ":http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/waves-ruby-framework, an interview with me by Robert Bazinet about motivations, future plans, etc.
  * "RubyInside":http://www.rubyinside.com/waves-a-new-rails-like-web-applications-framework-782.html
  
  Thanks to both Robert and Peter for the opportunity. It makes a difference: over the weekend, we picked up three new contributors ... and counting.
