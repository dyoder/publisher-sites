  h2. What Is Waves?
  
  Today's Web applications must embrace a wide variety of scenarios that don't really fit the Sun MVC paradigm that has dominated Web-based application architecture in the past. Think Ajax, Adobe Air, mashups, OpenID, rich-client mobile apps, and so on.
  
  Waves helps you meet these challenges by providing "a rich DSL":/resource-oriented for dealing with HTTP instead of trying to hide it from you. Waves Resource classes are faster and more flexible than typical routing schemes. And our "mixin approach":/foundations-and-layers provides just the architectural magic that your applications need, and nothing more.
  
  h2.  Try It Out

  At the moment, the only version of Waves that is compatible with the latest Rack gem is edge:
  
  <pre>
  sudo gem install waves-edge -s http://gems.github.com/
  </pre>
  
  You can also "run from source":/working-from-source if you like.
  
  From there, our "tutorials":/tutorials can help you get started.
