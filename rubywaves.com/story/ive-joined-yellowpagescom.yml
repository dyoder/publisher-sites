  I've signed on a YellowPages.com to lead the Solutions group within Strategic R&D. This is great for both me and for Waves, since it gives Waves a sponsor of sorts and offers lots of opportunity to work on Waves in real-world applications.
  
  As many of you may already know, YPC is one of the largest (if not _the_ largest) Ruby / Rails deployments in the world. YPC SRD is thus one of the few places where you can work with Ruby on innovative and exciting projects. We are also hiring, so if this sounds interesting, and you'd like to be able to work with technologies like Waves, "hit me up":mailto:dan@zeraweb.com. We are based out of LA, but have an office in SF and can also consider remote contract work.
  
  I've been busy getting settled in at YPC, which is partly why I haven't posted much to this blog. The other thing is that we now have a pretty solid core team (although it isn't too late to "join":http://groups.google.com/groups/ruby-waves) and we've been making some seriously interesting enhancements. These include:
  
  * A much-improved version of Autocode, which is this foundation of Waves class / module loader.
  * A new construct, called Layers, which allows developers to more easily override the default behavior of Waves by "layering" features onto an app.
  * Improved Windows support, enhanced mapping, the beginnings of a complete test suite, pluggable ORM, numerous bug fixes, and so on.
  
  We will be wrapping up these enhancements and getting the tests and documentation updated over the next few weeks, after which we will release the 0.8.0 gem. Subsequent to that, we will be focused also on getting a few sample apps out the door, and moving on to JRuby support.
  
  It has been an amazing three months since I originally released Waves into the wild and it is hard to believe that I now actually get paid to work on it. YPC is very committed to the Ruby and Open Source communities, and I think you will begin to see more and more of that over the coming months. I am happy to be a part of that and excited what we can accomplish together.
