  <p>Oh My God! That's all I can say. What I/we cooked tonight was so amazing.&nbsp;</p>
   
  <p>For years friends, family and most of all Dan, has been saying how I had a talent in the kitchen. I myself was never really sure about that. I thought "come on it's not that hard what I do, anyone can do it." I am beginning to have a little more confidence in myself and seeing maybe what I do is different then picking up a cook book and following recipes. Which by the way I am very bad at that is why, I guess, I make up my own!</p>
   
  <p>For Christmas I didn't cook a damn thing! We ate some awesome leftovers of things I made from 2 different nights. It was Fajita Meat with some of that yummy Mexican Jambalaya and fresh Avocado slices, with some Corn Tortillas &amp; plain yogurt(my sour cream!) &amp; pickled jalapenos on the side. We decided to be totally lazy on Christmas which was great. Well not totally lazy we rode our bikes down to the Promenade to catch a late movie.&nbsp;</p>
