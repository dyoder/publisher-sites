summary: Traditional Thanksgiving dishes with a little JJ flare!
content: |-
  <p>Well my dinner was a hit, (thank god!) I was a little nervous how the cranberry thing was going to turn out, but it turned out so well it actually went well with everything on the plates. I infused traditional Thanksgiving dishes with a little J.J. flare. Over dinner I had some feed back as to what to call some of the dishes I prepared mostly good ideas. Dan wasn&rsquo;t big on my green bean dish saying it tasted like the traditional green bean casserole. Of course I was offended mostly because I hate casseroles and mine is nothing like the canned shit, and little because I loved it and he should have too! No really it&rsquo;s okay He is my biggest fan and loved everything else. So here is the recipes for a Unique Thanksgiving Feast&hellip; <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">N.Y Strip w/a <a href="../../../cranberry-chutney">Red Wine Cranberry Chutney</a>-</span></p>
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">Mashed Sweet Potatoes w/Chipoltle Peppers-</span></p><ul> <li>peel and cut up your yams, boil in a pot of salted water, toss in a few garlic cloves peeled and smashed. Once very tender, drain and place in mixer bowl, set mixer to medium speed, add 1/2 stick of butter, splash of milk, fresh ground nutmeg, give the chipoltle peppers a rough chop &amp; toss in, pour a little of the adobe sauce in from the chipole peppers, finish off w/a splash or 2 of whiskey! Turn up the speed for one last whip.</li> </ul>
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">Green beans &amp; Crimini mushrooms w/ Love-</span></p><ul> <li> Boil fresh green beans in pot of salted water, chop up strips of bacon into small pieces (about 6 strips), heat large saute pan over medium heat, drizzle w/olive oil add bacon. Let cook until browned stirring occasionally, while browning chop up a large shallot, toss into pan w/bacon, chop up a few cloves of garlic and toss in pan, dice 12 crimini mushrooms toss in pan. keep mixing ingredients together. Don&rsquo;t worry about the browning in the bottom of the pan it will all come up when you add the love. The Love&hellip; in a food processor grind up chunks of parmesan &amp; smoked gouda. drain green beans add to pan, give it a mix and sprinkle w/cheese (about a cup) pour in heavy cream (almost a pint), mix it all up and let simmer about 10 min. </li> </ul>
  <p>The biggest hit of the evening was my dark chocolate candies! I served them after dinner with some Champagne. This is very simple to make&hellip;</p><ul> <li> Use your favorite kind of chocolate candy bar. I prefer Lindt 80% cocoa. break chocolate up in a double broiler pot, mix in spanish almonds (or your favorite nut), dried cherries &amp; blueberries, a few dashes of cinnamon &amp; cayenne pepper. Stir everything up until chocolate is melted. In a rectangle cake pan lined with wax paper, pour mixture in and smooth out, dust with coarse salt. let cool &amp; harden back to candy. cut into nice sized chunks and ENJOY!</li> </ul>
