  <p>Tonight I experimented with a latin meets cajun theme (mostly latin I think). There is probably something out there similar to what I made up but I have no idea since I just cook what I got. I was sort of in the &#8220;ropas viejas mixed with some jambalaya catagory with the ingredients I had to cook with. My flank steak was frozen solid so I had to use ground beef for this test, but I think I will try it with the flank steak soon. I love this recipe because I love cajun &amp; mexican foods and because Dan loved it and made himself sick eating it all! He came up with the name too&#8230; <span style="font-style:italic;" class="Apple-style-span">Mexican Jambalaya ingredients: yellow onion, garlic, carrots, red bell pepper, ground beef, 1 can diced tomato, cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, chicken habanero sausage , zucchini, purple onion, parsley, chicken stock, jasmine white rice, salt &amp; fresh ground black pepper.</span>
