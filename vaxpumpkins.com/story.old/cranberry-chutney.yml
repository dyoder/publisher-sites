  <p>Chutney: 1pkg fresh cranberries, 2 cups red wine(a sweet red is best),
  1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 1 large orange (or a few small) for juice
  and zest, 1 cinnamon stick, fresh ground nutmeg, whole black peppercorn
  (small palm size full), salt. Throw everything in a pot and let it cook
  down over medium heat. I covered the pot while the berries were
  bursting and to get it nice and hot. I also added water as it cooked to
  keep it from getting to thick, probably helped mellow the flavor as
  well. The smell was amazing! Salt &amp; Pepper steaks and grill to
  desired doneness. Serve the chutney over the steaks.</p>
