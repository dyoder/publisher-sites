  <p>Dinner last night was quite the ensemble so I decided to write about it. We just got back from a trip to Vegas (for my bday) and we were all very exhausted, but most of all Broke! I didn&rsquo;t want to waste money on delivery and had quite a few things in the fridge I felt sure I could do something with. I just didn&rsquo;t want to put a whole lot of effort forth. I had some left over Hawaiian bread that was still good but not for much longer. I hate throwing food away so I really wanted to use what I needed to before I had to waste it. I always have pasta and canned crushed tomatoes, I had some yellow onions, and garlic of course, and my basil and parsley plants were dying for me to cut them back. I also had some of my fresh tomato sauce w/meat I had froze from a batch of sauce I made previously, not enough for a meal for 4 though. Last I had some Italian salami (whole) left over from a cheese, salami, olives and red wine night. Oh yeah I had a red bell pepper begging to be cooked as well. Here&rsquo;s what I did&hellip;.</p><ul> <li> Dice 1 yellow onion toss into hot pot w/olive oil (medium heat)</li> <li>chop up 4 garlic cloves, toss in pot</li> <li>dice red bell pepper, toss in pot</li> <li>slice salami into 1/2 pieces toss in pot</li> <li>sprinkle in some dried oregano, give it all a mix</li> <li>boil water for pasta</li> <li>pour crushed tomatoes (28 oz can)in pot w/onions ect</li> <li>i let it cook for about 10 min to give the ingredients a chance to blend</li> <li>chop up 1 garlic clove and 4 pats of butter, melt together</li> <li>slice open hawaiian bread, lay bread on piece of foil, pour melted butter and garlic over bread, sprinkle w/salt, ground black pepper, &amp; shred some parmesan cheese on top, toast in oven (about 5 min if in broiler on 400)</li> <li>i added my leftover fresh tomato sauce w/meat and just let it simmer until pasta is done</li> <li>i gave the parsley and basil a rough chop and tossed into sauce</li> <li>take the pasta directly out of pasta water (do not drain) i use tongs to grab the noodles and drop into tomato sauce, giving it a mix in between drops. this lets you coat the noodles really well with sauce and pasta water.</li> </ul>
  <p>This might sound like a lot of work but it really isn&rsquo;t. It only took about 30 min to pull together.  You can be creative with what you already have lying around, using things like garlic salt if you don&rsquo;t have fresh garlic for the bread. You can use any kind of bread. Use up old packets from pizza delivery for the parmesan or spice things up w/cracked red pepper.</p>
