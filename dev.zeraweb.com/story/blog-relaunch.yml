  With the development shop at AT&T Interactive R&D (Web site coming soon) now in place (which is to say we now have nearly 30 extremely talented developers), and work on "Waves":http://rubywaves.com/, "PoolParty":http://labs.citrusbyte.com/poolparty, and "Rubinius":http://rubini.us/ (among "other things":http://speak4it.com/) proceeding apace, I finally have a chance to take a step back and put more energy into "evangelizing":http://ia.meetup.com/55/calendar/9532226/ our nascent vision of the future.
  
  What that means is, first and foremost, I am going to start writing again, primarily in this blog. (I will still write on the "Ruby Waves blog":http://rubywaves.com/blogs/HangTen, but expect to see more and more of those entries coming from our core team rather than me.) The major themes will include the "Resource-Oriented Web":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 (and how it relates to things like social networking and cloud computing), the convergence of tech, art, and entertainment across the "three screens":http://www.nielsen-online.com/blog/2008/12/01/we-all-scream-for-three-screens/, the emergence of a "tech scene in LA":http://mindshare.la that will soon rival Route 128 and Silicon Valley, and an ongoing exploration of the impact of innovation on society. Broad enough for ya?
  
  Ruby still has a place at the table, too. Ruby brought me back to real tech, "after a long dark journey":http://momentumsi.com "selling snake-oil":http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/329749-0-0-225-121.html?jumpid=ex_hphqglobal_wwtsg/BTO_Apps/soa/Google by reminding me that sometimes real innovation does happen and can be "fun.":http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Ruby At AT&T Interactive, we've definitely embraced Ruby as our agile language of choice and will continue to invest in making it the best possible platform for application  development. In fact, this is one of the areas that being associated with AT&T Labs is truly thrilling. Given that most modern software development today is based on technology they invented (and basically gave away, more on this in future posts), I am optimistic that we can do great things for Ruby if we put our minds to it.
  
  Lest someone make the mistake of thinking I am a hopeless corporate shill for the Death Star (since I've just admitted to selling out in the past), the whole point of what we're doing here is to follow Matz's lead and embrace the inherent creative joy of real innovation. That can happen even within large corporations, as attested by both Bell Labs and Google (and, yes, they count as a large corporation, people). We've brought together a critical mass of geek firepower (including a lot of folks who can "hardly be accused of selling out":http://blog.ted.com/2009/02/interview_with.php) and we have the resources and leverage to support them ... and _that_ is what this blog is ultimately about. It's a chance to open up a dialog (yes, we'll be adding support for comments, but for now just "tweet me":http://twitter.com/dyoder) about what the future looks like and introduce some of our cooler innovations and ideas.
  
  I hope you'll come along for the ride.
summary: With the development shop at AT&T Interactive R&D (Web site coming soon) now in place (which is to say we now have nearly 30 extremely talented developers), and work on "Waves":http://rubywaves.com/, "PoolParty":http://labs.citrusbyte.com/poolparty, and "Rubinius":http://rubini.us/ (among "other things":http://speak4it.com/) proceeding apace, I finally have a chance to take a step back and put more energy into "evangelizing":http://ia.meetup.com/55/calendar/9532226/ our nascent vision of the future.
