  For most of last year, I was involved in two things. Launching "Waves":http://rubywaves.com and AT&T Interactive Labs. We have gotten great support from the suits to do our thing, and our group has gone from nothing to going on 40 people in about a year. And although our "initial efforts":http://speak4it.com may be modest, rest assured we have much more in store. Including, of course, continued support for Waves and, more generally, resource-oriented architecture.
  
  What makes this opportunity so exciting is that AT&T is one of the few places where this kind of R&D effort can be successful. Not only does AT&T have a long history of R&D (via Bell Labs, which still exists in the form of AT&T Labs, creators of C, Unix, and, well, quite a bit of what we today call the Internet), but they also have a compelling need to invest heavily in the Web 2.0 space. Not only is it a high-growth opportunity for a company with a lot of cash to invest (and with several of their old mainstays in slow decline), but they have the marketing might to commercialize any reasonably promising advances we make.
  
  Our work today encompasses everything from "voice recognition":http://speak4it.com/ to social networking. We've recently hired Chris Hughes (not "that one":http://is.gd/Nc7, "this one":http://is.gd/gBQr), "Ari Lerner":http://labs.citrusbyte.com/poolparty, and "Eero Saynatkari":http://www.ohloh.net/p/rubinius/contributors/16361677958936, along with many other talented folks. They see the opportunity we have here to do great things on a big scale. More about our plans coming soon, both here and on our official blog (coming soon).
  
  For now I just wanted to get the word out and encourage people to find out more about what we're doing. And if you're a talented hacker with a bent towards thinking big, we're "hiring":mailto:dyoder@attinteractive!
  
  Oh, and happy MLK Day and Inauguration Day!
