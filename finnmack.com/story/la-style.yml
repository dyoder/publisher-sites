  <p>Hard to believe now, but I first started work on this album back in 2003, with <em>Gold</em>. I wrote <em>The Roosevelt</em> in 2005. There are a large number of other songs that were written during this period, along with an unreleased batch from an album called Way Down South. I will eventually get them all up here (most of them need to be remixed or have some new tracks put down), but for now, just these two will have to do.</p>
