  <p>Today in my test kitchen I&rsquo;m going to make:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Grilled N.Y. Strip Steak w/red wine cranberry sauce.</li>
  
  <li>Grilled Shrimp (the big juicy ones) tossed in garlic lemon pepper butter</li>
  
  <li>Green bean &amp; crimini mushrooms w/alfredo sauce &amp; fried onions</li>
  
  <li>Sweet Potato Fries (probably going to do mashed sweet potatoes w/garlic &amp; chipoltle because I don&rsquo;t have a deep fryer which would make the frying much easier since I have to do more than 1 potato) </li>
  
  <li>For little snacks I&rsquo;ll have my yummy popcorn. Today I will toss it with smoked aged gouda, butter &amp; garlic salt. I made my dark chocolate w/dried blueberries, cherries and marcona almonds, cinnamon, cayenne, &amp; nutmeg.(melted the chocolate &amp; mixed all the fruit &amp; spices in. then spread it out on wax paper to cool) </li>
  
  <li>I&rsquo;ll write recipes after I&rsquo;ve tested everything out on my lucky guests tonight! </li>
  
  </ul>
summary: Testing out a new holiday tradition on my victi - er, guests!
