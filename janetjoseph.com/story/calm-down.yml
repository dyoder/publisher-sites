  <p>After my rant yesterday and blabbing my emotions all over twitter and facebook, I've had time to calm down. Between PMS and just being sick of peoples bullshit, I let my emotions get the best of me, again.</p>
  
  <p>The system is broken and I can't imagine how it could ever be fixed. There are so many ways for people to abuse it that it becomes impossible to make any sense. I'm sure little tweeks here and there, some fine tunning can be done. But let's face it, you can't <strong>make</strong> people do the right thing or be a good parent. Abusers are who they are and all I can do is choose not to be around them.</p>
  
  <p>Why do I care about my stupid custody papers anyway? He's never ONCE followed them. The only reason to change them would be for a worse case senario, like I die. And in that case, I have plenty of people on my side who would be sure my child did <strong>not</strong> go with him.</p>
  
  <p>So I'm taking the law in my own hands because the law has too many other hands abusing it. It's always been my law anyway. Isn't that right douche bag! I don't want to spend anymore money on lawyers or hear anymore crap on the law. Keep your money and I'll keep mine. Cry and whine all you want, to whomever will listen. There is a world full of enablers who will listen. I'm through letting your pathetic life effect my good life. Over some silly legal document?! PALEAZzz!</p>
