   <ol> 
  <li>lay tortilla out on a plate or cutting board. tear a <strong>handful of lettuce</strong> mix up and lay on tortilla.</li>
  
  <li>slice <strong>1/2 of avocado</strong>, then make slices down the middle length wise. scoop out w/spoon and lay ontop of lettuce. squeeze lemon juice on top.</li>
  
  <li>slice <strong>1 hard boiled egg</strong> in half lengthwise then into slices. place on top of tortilla.</li>
  
  <li>cut <strong>1 cucumber</strong> in half, then slice about 5 pieces off, add to tortilla.<br /></li>
