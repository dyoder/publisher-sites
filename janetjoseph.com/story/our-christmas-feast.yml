  <p>&nbsp;What we cooked for our Christmas Feast was so amazing!</p>
  
  <p>Actually on &nbsp;Christmas I didn't cook a damn thing! We ate some awesome leftovers of things I made from 2 different nights. It was Fajita Meat(<span style="font-style: italic;">night 1</span>) with some of that yummy Mexican Jambalaya<span style="font-style: italic;">(night 2)</span> and fresh Avocado slices, with some corn tortillas, plain yogurt(my sour cream!) &amp; pickled jalapenos on the side. We decided to be totally lazy on Christmas which was great. Well not totally lazy we rode our bikes down to the Promenade to catch a late movie.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;For our "Special Holiday Dinner" I had been working out what I was going to do with those ingredients I listed in my earlier ranting blog. What came out was so simple, yet so delicious. I was very proud of myself. We had <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smoked tri-tip roast w/cornbread &amp; fig stuffing, &nbsp;green beans w/crimini mushrooms saut&eacute;ed in red wine &amp; a ginger cranberry chutney.</span></span></p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>I made my own cornbread jalape&ntilde;o muffins the day before. Any recipe will do, I got one off the "world wide web!" ;)</li>
  
  <li>&nbsp;The day of, I prepared the tri-tip roast dusting it with garlic salt, cayenne pepper and plenty of course black pepper. Set that aside and let it come to room temperature.</li>
  
  <li>On to the veggies - Maia and I trimmed up the green beans threw 'em in a pot and boiled them. Drain the beans when they are at desired tenderness. I like mine pretty tender, also do not ever cover the beans.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>For the chutney I boiled the fresh cranberries (one bag) in a small pot. Cover berries with water. Add 1 cup of freshly squeezed oj (or regular oj). 2 big orange peels &amp; a cinnamon stick. Add a 1/2 cup of sugar &amp; honey. Let that simmer and move on to mushrooms.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>We then cleaned up our mushrooms by wiping the tops with a damp paper towel, then removed the stems. Just give them a gentle twist and pull. We quartered them and tossed them in our saut&eacute; pan, over medium low heat, with a little olive oil. Don't worry too much if they start sticking to the bottom.<span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><span style="font-style: italic;">we are going to de-glaze w/red wine so let 'em cook down a bit mixing occasionally) -</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Go back to the cranberries and grate in fresh ginger. Dice up a small purple onion and add to cranberries. Continue to let simmer.</span></li>
  
  <li>Start chopping the veggies for the stuffing. I used: celery, garlic, yellow onion, apples, figs; and dried lavender, thyme, fresh sage for the herbs. I heated another saute pan over medium heat drizzled with olive oil and a few pats of butter. Then dice up the onion, toss in the pan. Go ahead and sprinkle in the dried herbs, lavender &amp; thyme, a few good sized pinches. Chop up a few ribs of celery, toss in pan. Chop figs into pretty small pieces, toss in pan. Chop up 1 apple (I used granny smith), toss it in. Finish w/ fresh sage. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: I use some dry and fresh herbs because that is what I had. Use what ever combo you have. </span>Pour 1 cup chicken stock in and start crumbling in cornbread muffins. I used about 6 average sized muffins. Add more stock if your stuffing gets to dry or muffins if it's to wet. Cover &amp; simmer.</li>
  
  <li>De-Glaze mushrooms w/ a few swirls of red wine mixing it all together. Add green beans, a little salt &amp; fresh black pepper and let simmer together. It's almost all done!</li>
  
  <li>Dan had the grill ready to go. We use a charcoal grill. The coals are nice and hot so we put the roast on and let the flames sear the outside of the meat. Turning about every 5 min until all sides are nice and crisp. Sealing in all those flavorful juices. We removed the roast and added our soaked wood chips over the coals. Then placed the roast back on grill, covered and let it smoke for about 30 min. Depending on the size and thickness will determine how long it should stay on the grill. We like ours cooked to a nice medium red in the middle. Next we took it off the grill and let it rest for about 5min. I gave my veggies and stuffing one last look over. Turned off all burners and get it all ready to serve. (if you use fancy serving dishes, we just serve from the pots)&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>The final touch... thinly slice the roast against the grain and serve up with some yummy ginger cranberry chutney! (Now that's our version of a turkey w/gravy.)</li>
  
  </ul>
