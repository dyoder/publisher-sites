  <p>For dinner Saturday night, I made my usual fresh tomato sauce w/meat, only it didn't taste like the "usual" sauce. I am going to retrace my steps and set in stone what made it so tasty.</p>
  
  <p>It started with these beautiful roma tomatoes I picked up at Costco. (I love Costco!) I'm guessing I had at least 24 tomatoes because I picked up two packs and you all know how big things are at Costco.</p>
  
  <p>They sat on my counter for about two days. I knew their time was limited and I needed to use them. These romas were beauties, too, because they came attatched to their vines and looked perfect. Now I know there is the whole organic movement out there, but these looked fresh and quite tastey, so into my sauce they went.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>I started with heating my old Dansk Dutch oven up over medium heat. I drizzled it with olive oil and quickly chopped up a yellow onion. I left the pieces a little bigger than diced or jullianne. I wanted the onion to hold up in the sauce. Toss onion in pot.<br /></li>
  
  <li>While the onion was carmelizing in the pot, I began cutting up the tomatoes.  I cut them in half starting at the top and slicing down, and then in half again length wise, and then again across. You should come out with 8 pieces from 1 tomato. I did about 6 with the first batch. <br /></li>
  
  <li>Give onions a stir, sprinkle  a little salt and fresh black pepper into the pot. <br /></li>
  
  <li>Now back to the tomatoes. I finished chopping and tossed them into the blender w/some course salt. I did about 10 at a time in the blender for a total of 20 tomatoes. (I saved some for a salad and to toss into the sauce at the end.) I have a chop setting on my blender, so I pulsed the ingredients around until the tomatoes were chopped up. <br /></li>
  
  <li>In between batches of tomatoes, I added about 2 lbs of extra lean ground beef to the pot. I sprinkled with salt, fresh black pepper &amp; cracked red pepper (about a palm full) and gave it a good mix. Then I let it brown, mixing occasionally. <br /></li>
  
  <li>On to some garlic. I smashed and peeled 4 nice sized cloves of garlic, then chopped 'em up almost to a minced stage. You can probably save some time by doing it through a garlic press, but I don't have one and I don't mind chopping! I added the garlic to the pot and mixed the ingredients together. I broke up the meat a little but not too much because I like it kind of chunky.</li>
  
  <li>Once the meat was nice and cooked, I poured in the tomatoes. I mixed it all up again, tossed in a few bay leaves, and let it cook down. The tedious part was over.  Time to sit back and enjoy a glass of wine or a dirty martini! After about 20 min., I added chopped red and yellow bell peppers (1 ea.), about 12 of those quartered pieces of tomato (2 tomatoes), and a hand full of chopped flat-leaf parsley. I mixed it up again and let it be for another 30 min.</li>
  
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>I removed the bay leaves and served it over angel hair pasta. (You can use your favorite pasta) My batch made a lot of sauce so I jarred some to store in the fridge for another night. It's good for up to 2 weeks if in an air-tight jar. <br /></li>
  
  <li>I use my tongs to take the pasta out of the water, and mix it directly into the sauce. I do not strain my pasta! This helps give the pasta a nice coating of sauce, and adds flavor to the sauce from the pasta water.<br /></li>
  
  </ul>
  <p><em>Ingredients: 1 yellow onion, 20 something roma tomatoes, 2 lbs extra lean ground beef, 4 garlic cloves; course salt, fresh black pepper, cracked red pepper; 1 red &amp; yellow bell pepper, flat-leaf parsley, bay leaves.</em></p>
