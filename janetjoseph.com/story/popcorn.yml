  If you're tired of bland tasteless microwave and movie popcorn, try this recipe out. Quick, easy, and makes watching movies with friends and family extra special. For the bold, sneak some into the movie theater instead of paying $5 for stale movie popcorn ...
  
  *ingredients.* yellow popcorn, canola oil, butter, salt.
  
  # 3 tbs. canola oil/ coat bottom of pan. heat pot over medium heat.
  # 1 cup kernels/  (enough to cover the bottom) swish around in oil
  # 3 tbs. butter/ scatter over top of kernels. 
  # sprinkle with salt, cover and let pop! give it a few shakes while popping.
  # when popping slows turn off heat, give it a shake and let sit a minute more.
  # remove from heat, uncover, pour in big bowl, add salt to taste.
  
  *suggestions.* i use a heavy bottom 4 quart pot.
  
  you can melt some salted butter and pour over top for added butter flavor.
  
  i love sprinkling a little hot sauce(tapatio or tabasco) on top! mmm ...
  
  even better, crumble some blue cheese in and mix it around, goes great with red wine & a movie!
