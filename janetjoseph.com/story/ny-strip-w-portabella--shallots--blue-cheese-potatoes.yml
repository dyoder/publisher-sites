  <p>This is one of my favorites, and very easy to pull together. You will need: n.y. strip steak (or whichever kind you prefer), portabella mushrooms, some shallot and garlic cloves, blue cheese and russet potatoes. How much of these ingredients you will need is up to you. I cooked for 2 so I had 2 steaks, 2 portabellas, 1 potato, and the rest you can eyeball. Let's get started!</p>
  
  <p>First get your steaks ready. Pull them out of the fridge and their package. Let them come to room&nbsp;temperature.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <ol> 
  <li>wash off potatoes, chop up into chunky pieces, toss into a pot cover with water, let cook over medium high heat. chop up about 3 garlic cloves and add to the potatoes. Salt the water and let come to a boil. Once they boil turn down the heat to medium low. (I leave the skins on the potatoes because I love them)</li>
  
  <li>Heat a skillet over hight heat and drizzle with olive oil. Season the steaks with coarse salt &amp; coarse black pepper. When the skillet just begins to smoke, set the steaks on. Let each side sear for about 7-10 min. each (depending on thickness, less for thinner steaks) You only want to flip the steaks one time so be sure they are nice and brown and&nbsp;caramelized&nbsp;before you flip. Heat your oven up to 300, we are going to finish the steaks in there.</li>
  
  <li>While the steaks are searing, slice up a few shallot cloves and the portabellas. Transfer your steak to the oven on a cookie sheet on the highest rack. Turn down the skillet the steaks were on to low heat and throw the mushrooms and shallots into the hot pan. Add a little salt &amp; pepper &amp; olive oil, let them cook down. Check the potatoes, if they are fork tender drain them. Place them in a large bowl and add a few table spoons of butter, crumble the blue cheese in with a fork (as much as you like) salt &amp; pepper, and a few splashes of half &amp; half. (the half &amp; half depends on how many potatoes you made you don't want it soupy so go slow with that) Get a masher or a big fork and mix and mash it all up.</li>
  
  <li>Turn off the oven, back to the mushrooms, turn off the heat, take some red wine, whatever you are drinking or have left over and and drizzle it over the mushrooms. This will de-glaze the skillet and add awesome flavor! I used about a 1/2 cup. It will cook down quickly because of the hot pan. Remove the steaks and put them on a plate. Pour the shallots and mushrooms over the steak. Scoop blue cheese potatoes on plate and, WaLa! So Good!</li>
