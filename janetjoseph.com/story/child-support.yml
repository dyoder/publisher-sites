  <p>I waited 2 hours for a conf. call with the Travis county enforcement officer between me and Charlie. The officer called me a few hours later and let me know Charlie never showed up. I think, of course he didn't! When I ask well what happens now? She says nothing. He will go to his scheduled court hearing and the judge will ask him how much he can afford to pay and then he will have to pay what ever little amount he decides he can afford. This will continue about every 3 months. He will go before a judge and be asked how much he can afford! The officer tells me well we can make it every 6 months to make it less inconvient for him.</p>
  <p>UMMMM no thanks! I think he can go every 3 months, I mean he's 10 years behind for gods sake. He should be in jail! By the way they don't really throw dead beat parents in jail. They see it as a little payment is better than none. And they don't care that the parent who has been financially responsible for the child would rather have him in jail, better yet his rights taken away than have what tiny bit of money he coughs up. I've taken care of her this long without the money, it is clearly not about the money. PUT HIM IN JAIL or take his rights away.</p>
