  <p>This is a ridiculously delicious ice cream treat! It's a sophisticated way to enjoy a simple dessert with out going to a fancy ice cream parlor and paying big prices. I've combined coffee flavored ice cream, heath bar &amp; dark chocolate reeses peanut butter cups candy and ginger snap cookies. Then I finished it with cinnamon sugar and some fresh pitted cherries. Very easy to pull together and fun to make.</p>
  <p><ol>
  <li>start with the candy &amp; cookies. take your heath bar and give it a few good whacks with a rolling pin to break the candy into pieces. chop up the reeses cups and ginger snap cookies. combine it all together in a bowl. ( i like to use a stainless steel bowl out of the freezer)</li>
  <li>scoop the coffee flavored ice cream into the bowl and mix it all up.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>take a few pitted &nbsp;fresh cherries and and give them a quick chop.(i have this very cool new kitchen gadget... a cherry pitter! awesome!) almost done.</li>
  <li>scoop the ice cream into bowls top with cherries and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top.</li>
  </ol>This is one tasty dessert. I love to serve it with a glass of champagne with some of those pitted cherries in the glass!</p>
