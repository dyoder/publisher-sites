  <p><br /><strong>Ingredients</strong>: dry lentils, habanero green chili chicken sausage, green bell pepper, white onion, garlic, fresh sage, fennel seed, coriander powder, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, chicken stock.<br /><br />Soak 2 cups of lentils in water for about 3-5 hours before cooking. (in a warm place is best) Lentils will soak up a lot of the water.</p>
  
  <p>I cooked this stew in layers all in the same pot. Start with <strong>infusing spices</strong> in olive oil.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cover bottom of pot with olive oil. heat over low heat. add in 1tsp fennel seed, 1 tsp coriander, 2 tsp cayenne pepper, 2 tsp smoked paprika, 2 tsp garlic powder. mix spices together.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dice onion (1 sm. onion or 1/2 of larger onion) toss into pot with olive oil infusion. season with salt &amp; pepper, kick heat up to med. and mix it all up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dice green pepper, add to pot. take 2 sausage links slice in half lengthwise, slice in half again, then dice sausage, add to pot, stir. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; chop 4 garlic cloves, add to pot.&nbsp; chop 6-8 leaves of sage and add to pot. drain lentils and add to pot. cover with chicken stock (4 cups) stir. cover pot and lower heat to low. let simmer 30min. <br /><strong>Eat and Enjoy!</strong></p>
summary: The star of this stew is the infused olive oil.
