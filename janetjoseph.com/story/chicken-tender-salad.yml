  <p>Another delicious salad out of JJ's kitchen. I soaked the tenders in buttermilk for about 2 days, but you can get away with a few hours.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ingredients: 6 chicken tenders, 2 cups buttermilk, flour, olive oil, 1 bag of salad mix, tomatoes, avocado, 1/2 lemon, 1tbs. red wine vinegar.</strong></p>
   <ol> 
  <li>heat 1 cup of olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat.</li>
  
  <li>pour about 2 cups of flour on a plate and season with salt &amp; pepper. dredge marinated tenders through flour.</li>
  
  <li>place tenders in hot oil. fry for about 3-5 min each side, until golden brown.</li>
  
  <li>drain on a rack. don't over crowd skillet. cook in batches if needed.</li>
  
  <li>in a bowl mix 3 tbs. of olive oil, 2 tbs. of lemon juice and a splash of red wine vinegar. whisk together until creamy looking. add 1 avocado sliced up, and sliced tomatoes to bowl. season with salt and pepper. lay greens on top of that then toss everything together.</li>
   </ol> 
  <p>Serve greens on a plate and lay sliced pieces of chicken tenders on top.</p>
