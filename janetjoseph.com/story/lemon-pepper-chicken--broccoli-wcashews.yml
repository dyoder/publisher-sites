  <p>My latest craving has been broccoli... of all things! I'm not a big fan of the stuff either but my body has decided it needs it. So, I said okay body lets have some broccoli, but we have to come up with ways to make it yummy! Here is one of the many recipes I've come up with. Coming soon is Orange Beef Broccoli. Just gotta make that again because I can't remember exact measurments.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> long grain white rice, red pepper flakes, lemon pepper, garlic salt. chicken tenders, lemon juice &amp; zest. broccoli, green bell pepper, garlic, eggs, soy sauce.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Marinate chicken for about 3 hours</strong> before making. Pour 1/3 cup of lemon juice in ziplock bag. Add 2 tbls of lemon pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder into bag. Place chicken in bag and give it a good shake. Place in fridge.</p>
  
  <ol> 
  <li><strong>Rice</strong>: heat a pot over med. heat and drizzle w/olive oil. pour <strong>1 1/2&nbsp; cups of rice</strong> into pot. add <strong>2 tsp of red pepper flakes</strong>, <strong>1 tsp of garlic salt </strong>and<strong> 1 tbls of lemon pepper</strong>. toast rice for about 5 min. cover rice with hot water, about <strong>3 cups</strong>. let rice come to a boil and then cover and lower heat to low.</li>
  
  <li>heat wok or large non stick skillet over high heat. drizzle w/olive oil and lay chicken tenders in. cook for about 5 min. on each side. </li>
  
  <li>while chicken is cooking, chop<strong> 2 broccoli florets</strong> into small pieces. (you can thinly slice stalks of broccoli to use in stir fry too.) chop <strong>1 bell pepper</strong> into small bite size pieces. thinly slice<strong> 2 garlic cloves</strong>.</li>
  
  <li>remove chicken from wok and add in broccoli and bell peppers. sprinkle with a few pinches of red pepper flakes and season w/garlic salt. cook veggies for about 10 min. mixing everything together a few times. (broccoli will turn a deep bright green)<br /></li>
  
  <li>push veggies to the sides of wok and add 3 eggs to the middle. let the eggs cook for a min then slowly mix everything together. turn heat to low. take 2 handfuls of cashews, crush them in hands and drop into wok. add sliced garlic.</li>
  
  <li>chop chicken into bite size pieces and add to wok. turn heat back up to med. heat to let the chicken finish cooking.</li>
  
  <li>make a well in center of wok again (push everything up the sides) and scoop rice into center. add <strong>1 tsp of lemon zest</strong> and drizzle a little soy sauce over wok. mix it all up and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
