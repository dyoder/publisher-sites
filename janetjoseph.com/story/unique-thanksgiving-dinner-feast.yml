  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">N.Y Strip w/a <a href="/cranberry-chutney">Red Wine Cranberry Chutney</a>-</span></p>
  <p>Chutney: 1pkg fresh cranberries, 2 cups red wine, 2 cups of water, 1
  cup sugar, 1/4 cup honey, 1 cinnamon stick, fresh ground nutmeg,
  cracked black peppercorn and salt to taste. n.y strip steaks</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>throw everything in a pot and let it cook down over medium heat.
  cover the pot to bring the berries to a boil quicker. this also helps
  when the berries start to bust from making a mess. once it comes to a
  boil, uncover remove lid and let it simmer. stir occasionally until
  sauce thickens.</li>
  <li>salt &amp; pepper steaks and grill to desired done-ness. serve the
  chutney over the steaks. steaks take the least amount of time to cook,
  so don&rsquo;t cook until almost ready to serve dinner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Whipped Sweet Potatoes w/Chipoltle Peppers &amp; Whiskey-</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">about 4
  sweet potatoes, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 stick of butter, cream, ground
  nutmeg, chipoltle peppers in adobe sauce, 1/4 cup of whiskey<br /> </span></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>cut yams into pieces, put in a pot and cover with water. toss in
  a few garlic cloves peeled and smashed. once yams are tender, drain and
  pour into a bowl. add butter, splash of cream and freshly ground nutmeg
  (about a tsp.of nutmeg). give 3 chipoltle peppers a rough chop and add to bowl,
  add a few spoon fulls of the adobe sauce. finish off with a few
  splashes of whiskey! use a mixer and whip yams until smooth and creamy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Green beans &amp; Crimini mushrooms w/ Love-</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">1/2 lb.
  fresh greenbeans (trimmed), 6 strips of bacon, 12 crimini mushrooms,
  parmesan and aged smoked guoda cheese, 1 cup heavy cream, a few
  shallots and garlic cloves, exta virgin olive oil, salt &amp; pepper.<br /> </span></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li> boil green beans in pot of salted water until tender. chop up
  strips of bacon into small pieces. heat large saute pan over medium
  heat, drizzle w/olive oil add bacon. let cook stirring occasionally,
  until crispy. remove from pan and place bacon on a paper towel. drain
  some of the bacon fat out of pan and return to low heat. chop up a
  large shallot or a few small ones, chop a few cloves of garlic and toss
  in pan. roughly chop and dice 12 crimini mushrooms toss in pan. add
  some cracked black pepper and a tiny bit of salt. (it&rsquo;s probably okay
  not to salt this because the bacon and cheese are both salty). keep
  mixing ingredients together. don&rsquo;t worry about the browning in the
  bottom of the pan. The Love&hellip; in a food processor grind up pieces of
  parmesan &amp; smoked guoda (or use grated cheese). drain green beans
  and add to pan, give it a mix and sprinkle w/cheese, about a cup. pour
  in heavy cream (at room tempature), mix it all up and let simmer about
  10 min.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The biggest hit of the evening was my dark chocolate candies! I served them after dinner with some Champagne. This is very simple to make&hellip;</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Use your favorite kind of chocolate candy bar. I prefer Lindt 80% cocoa. break chocolate up in a double broiler pot, mix in spanish almonds (or your favorite nut), dried cherries &amp; blueberries, a few dashes of cinnamon &amp; cayenne pepper. Stir everything up until chocolate is melted. In a rectangle cake pan lined with wax paper, pour mixture in and smooth out, dust with coarse salt. let cool &amp; harden back to candy. cut into nice sized chunks and ENJOY!</li>
  
  </ul>
