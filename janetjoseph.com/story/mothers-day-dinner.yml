  <p>For Mothers day I decided to make one of my favorite things to eat, steak &amp; potatoes! Now before anyone says "what you cooked for yourself on mothers day?!" The answer is yes and I wouldn't have it any other way. Steaks can be really pricey at a restaurant, but not only that you can't get creative or cook things just the way you like it. It's all fine if your out for the sake of being out. But for special occasions I like to cook for myself and make things just the way I like them. Especially if the special occasion is one of our many Hallmark holidays. Those days you are fighting crowds, dealing with tired over worked waitstaff, and over priced items. For me, I prefer to be at home on days like those.</p>
  
  <p>My Mother's Day Menu: grilled N.Y. strip steaks, yukon gold potatoes with blue cheese, roasted asparagus, portabella mushroom &amp; cherry topping for steaks &amp; a salad.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>ingredients: n.y. strip steak (or your favorite steak), yukon gold potatoes, blue cheese, plain yogurt, green onion, shallots, garlic, butter, portobello mushrooms, pancetta, fresh cherries, asparagus, your favorite salad ingredients.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <ol> 
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">i started with seasoning the steaks &amp; asparagus. i salt &amp; peppered both sides of steaks &amp; asparagus, i also added some cracked red pepper flakes to the asparagus. set them aside. next i browned the pancetta. i did about 12 thinly sliced pieces. while that is browning i began cutting the potatoes into bite size pieces, keeping an eye on my pancetta. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(i did the potatoes bite size because i didn't mash them, rather i cooked them to fork tender and then mixed them together with the blue cheese.)&nbsp;</span></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">remove the pancetta once it is nice and crispy from the pan and let it drain on a paper towel. keep the pan with all the pancetta bits for cooking the mushroom &amp; cherry's in.</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">put the potatoes in a pot and cover with water, just until it covers the top of the potatoes. toss 3-5 whole peeled garlic cloves in and salt the water. cook over medium heat until potatoes are fork tender. i like mine on the softer side, about 20-30 min. turn off heat, strain and put back in pot. add about a 1/2 stick of butter, salt &amp; pepper and cover to come back to.</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">dice up portabella mushrooms, seed about a dozen fresh cherries, chop up a few shallots &amp; cloves of garlic. heat pancetta pan back up and toss in all these ingredients. add salt &amp; pepper. let the mushrooms cook down for about 15 min. then add about a cup of good red wine. let that simmer&nbsp;</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">now the steaks &amp; asparagus. i use a charcoal grill so i got my coals lit. once the fire died down a little and the coal had grey corners, i put the asparagus on. they don't take anytime at all. when they had nice color and grill marks i moved them off to the cool side of the grill. then i placed my steaks on. the fat from the steaks gets the fire going and will sear the outside of the meat locking in all that flavor and juice. i had thick steaks so i did about 10 min each side. (that's for medium centers)i pushed those off to the cool side and covered it for about 5 min. not too long if you want it pink in the middle.&nbsp;</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">remove everything from grill and let the steaks rest for a few min. while you finish up the potatoes. pour about 1/2 cup of blue cheese crumbles over potatoes. add 1/4 cup of plain yogurt. (i used about 6 potatoes) use a big fork, mix and lightly mash potatoes. garnish with green onion &amp; a little pancetta pieces.&nbsp;</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">plate everything up, pour mushroom &amp; cherry topping over steaks &amp; garnish salad with the rest of the pancetta.</span></li>
   </ol> 
  <p>for desert i had coffee flavored ice cream with toffee bars crushed in it and almond sparkling wine. that was amazing together! serve the ice cream in wine glasses and you have a fun and tasty dessert.</p>
