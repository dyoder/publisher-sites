  <p>Fried rice is my latest addiction and rather than ordering it out all the time, I decided I was going to figure out how to make it. I read a few different recipe's and to my my surprise, it can be quite fun to experiment with. It's also healthier and tastier making it yourself since you can control the amount of fats and types of meat to use. Don't you hate it when you get tough meat in your dishes? I do!</p>
  
  <p>First of all fried rice is actually a cleaning out the fridge meal. It is typically day old rice and other leftovers from asian dishes that are all thrown together. Of course you can make it from fresh ingredients too, but, it is best to use day old rice.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a big fan of brown rice so that's what I used. It's a little different than cooking with white rice but it still works. I also used some of my favorite veggies and I've done it with several different kinds of meat. The last batch I made was with thin cut pork chops that I diced up and it is by far my favorite.</p>
  
  <p>You will need to have all your ingredients ready to go because you have to cook it over high heat so it cooks very fast. You can't be chopping and cooking. If you don't have the time to chop veggies and such, just buy them already chopped. Also everywhere I read says use a wok, but I don't have one so I've been using my giant saute pan. It has tall enough sides so nothing falls out, and it's big enough to push things to the side for cooking in sections. So you will need a large enough pan to accomplish this task. If not you have to take each ingredient out after you've cooked it then put it all back together at the end. Non-stick pans are best.</p>
  
  <p>Veggies &amp; Herbs: 2-3 carrots, 1 onion, 1 yellow 1 red bell pepper, jalapeno, 3 garlic cloves minced, 1/4 cup ginger minced, green onion, cilantro,&nbsp;1 cup edemame (shelled), lime</p>
  
  <p>Protein: boneless pork chops, firm tofu, 3 eggs</p>
  
  <p>Nuts: 1/4 cup cashews (chopped up)</p>
  
  <p>Asian flavoring: soy sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar</p>
  
  <p>Seasoning: fine black pepper (use white pepper if you have it), crushed red pepper</p>
  
  <p>3 cups cooked brown rice. (about 1-1/2 cups uncooked)</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>chop your veggies &amp; protein into bite size pieces, not to small because you don't want them to cook down to much.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>heat pan up over high heat add vegetable oil to coat bottom of pan. right when it starts to smoke add meat, you can turn the heat down to med. high. let it cook a few min. stirring a couple of times &amp; season with salt &amp; pepper. push to the edge of pan.</li>
  
  <li>add tofu, let it cook on both sides a min. or 2. gently push to edges.</li>
  
  <li>add a little more oil (2-tblsp.) pour in 3 eggs, let the egg whites cook for a min., then mix the eggs together until scrambled, push to edge.</li>
  
  <li>toss in onion,carrots, bell peppers, garlic, ginger let it cook a few min. drizzle with soy sauce.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>pour in rice, squeeze in chili sauce. more or less depending how spicy you want it, drizzle with more soy sauce and add a few drops of sesame oil.</li>
  
  <li>mix everything in the pan together, add more soy sauce and chili sauce if needed. finish with mixing in cilantro, green onion and edemame, squeeze in juice from half of lime.</li>
  
  </ul>
