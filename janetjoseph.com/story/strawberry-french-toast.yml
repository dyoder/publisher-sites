  <p>I served my <strong>Strawberry French Toast</strong> with a fried
  egg, over medium, on the side. The yolk from the egg added a delicious
  sauce to the plate. It was a big hit! I fried the eggs in a few tbs. of
  olive oil and a pat of butter, flipping them once. season with salt
  &amp; pepper.</p>
summary: I knocked the socks off my boyfriend and daughter, AGAIN! This french toast was super super yummy!
