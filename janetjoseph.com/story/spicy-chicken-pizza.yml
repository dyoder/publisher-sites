  <p>I've made yet another "can't get enough of this to eat" meal! I'm beginning to believe I truly do have a gift with food. Could it possibly be creating delicious food is my talent? In a time over populated with culinary wannabe's? I come from a long line of family cookouts, not from an education from culinary school and maybe that's what will make me stand out. I don't follow many cooking rules. In fact I make my own rules.</p>
  <p>For this recipe I was inspired by one of my girlfriends. She and I have our little spot we like to go to for this mouth watering spicy chicken pizza. We always order the same thing... olive tapenade, spicy chicken pizza, and a bottle of procceco. It all goes perfectly together believe it or not. Most people turn their nose up when I say we have procceco with pizza. Yet another way I think outside the box. Anyway she absolutely loves this pizza we get so I came up with my own knock off version!</p>
  <p>Now lets get to my spicy chicken pizza...</p>
  <p>you will need some chicken breasts</p>
  <p>hot sauce (like tobasco. i prefer valentino's)</p>
  <p>red pepper flakes</p>
  <p>extra version olive oil (i used some that is infused with basil!)</p>
  <p>mozzarella cheese (the fresh kind is the best)</p>
  <p>pizza dough (any kind will do. i used the pilsbury kind in the biscuit dept. i've also used flat bread)</p>
  <p><ol>
  <li>heat the oven up to whatever the package says. I did 425.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>heat a skillet over medium high heat for the chicken breasts. season chicken breast with hot sauce, salt &amp; pepper, red pepper flakes, on both sides. drizzle some olive oil in pan and place breasts in hot skillet. let them cook about 15 min. on each side so the outsides get browned.</li>
  <li>slice up fresh mozzarella into thin pieces. (tip: place in freezer about 20 min. before you're ready to slice it up) of course you can use the already grated mozzarella too but it's not the same.</li>
  <li>turn the heat on the chicken down to medium low. remove one of the breasts from the skillet and place on a cutting board and chop it into small pieces. place it back in pan and get the next breast until all the chicken is diced up.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>unroll dough onto greased cookie sheet or pizza stone. dust dough with salt &amp; pepper and drizzle with basil infused olive oil. add red pepper flakes for some kick.</li>
  <li>cover dough with chicken pieces, drizzle over chicken some more hot sauce, cover chicken with mozzarella slices, drizzle a little basil olive oil and sprinkle a little more red pepper flakes on top of cheese.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>place pizza in oven for about 15 min. until cheese starts to bubble and brown. let it cool for a few min. before cutting into it.</li>
  </ol>note: i've done this pizza several different ways now. i've used some already cooked breads like flat bread. it's thick enough and doesn't get soggy. I've added bacon to this, (that's for the man), and i've put tomatoes on top. grape tomatoes work well if you slice them in thin pieces, but if you use bigger tomatoes they have more water in them and will make the pizza soggy. all you have to do is slice up a few tomatoes and then squeeze all the water out with your hands. then spread them over the top of the cheese.</p>
