  <p>This is a vegetarian dish believe it or not! I always cook with some kind of meat but tonight I didn't have any and I was just feeling like something light. I happen to have had a lot of ginger left from other stir fry's I made. I absolutely love ginger! It has this crisp, fresh with a little hint of spicy to it, so delicious. I also had a carrot, some cherry tomatoes, shelled edamame, cilantro and a yellow onion. That's it! Well I always have certain spices on hand so of course those helped to give me extra flavor.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>For the rice: I used brown rice. Cook it according to the package. Something I always do with brown rice is bring the liquid to a boil then add the rice. Typically I use chicken stock to cook the rice in but, ya, didn't have any. To boost the rice and give it some flavor I added a tsp. of onion powder, 2 tsp. of garlic salt, a bay leave and 1 tsp. of sesame oil.</p>
  
  <p>For the veggies: Heat a large non stick skillet or wok up.</p>
  
  <p></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dice up the carrot and ginger. Thinly slice onion.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>Drizzle a little bit of olive oil in pan and toss the veggies into hot pan.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>Slice a handful of cherry tomatoes up, toss them in pan. Drop 2 handfuls of edamame in pan.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>Crack some black pepper in pan and a few dashes of garlic salt.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>Push everything to the side of pan and crack three eggs into pan. Let them cook for a minute then mix up with veggies.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>Push everything back to sides and add rice, drizzle some rice vinegar and soy sauce all around pan. Toss in some chopped cilantro and mix everything together one last time.<br /></li>
  
  </ul>
