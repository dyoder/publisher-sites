  <p>I just found out that my child's father has gone on yet another exotic trip. Now, I don't care at all where this man travels to, or what he does with his life. All I want is to change my custody papers. Clearly my child is not going to see the money he owes.</p>
  
  <p>As of now we have joint custody. 10 years ago I set this up because I was young and stupid and thought he'd actually want a hand in raising our child. 12 years later he has done very little. That little he has done, was me insisting he play a role. One day I stopped insisting. Now he's decided I've robbed him of his child and everything is my fault. He's a blamer and a taker, he's nothing but a weak man.</p>
  
  <p>What<strong> he</strong> thinks is my fault is that he owes over <strong>$40K</strong> in child support and that I have poisoned my childs mind against him. No idiot, you did this all yourself! In his delusional mind, he seems to think he's paid me some of this money. As if handing me $60 or $100 every few months is paying child support. Really, I kid you not, that's what this silly man thinks!</p>
  
  <p>In my fight I've heard the same things over and over. They'll put them in<strong> jail</strong>, take away their <strong>drivers license</strong>, <strong>garnish wages</strong>. Sure that's all great if you are dealing with someone who has a license, or a regular job. I have no idea what the jail thing is about. They've never put this guy in jail for child support. DUI's sure but not child support. And yeah, he's had 3 DUI's! I hear about all these things "they will do" but have never seen anything done.</p>
  
  <p>I'm now realizing all these people advising me, have never fought this kind of battle themselves. I've had 4 differnt lawyers only to cost me over $5K and no results. I'd like to help other single parents who are fighting a system that is clearly broken, not make some of the costly mistakes I've made. The few people I know going through similar issues just give in saying, it is what it is. Where do all of us who are fighting this broken system start?</p>
