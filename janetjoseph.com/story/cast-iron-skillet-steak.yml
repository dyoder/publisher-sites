  <p>My biggest fan told me to write down the way I did this steak EXACTLY like I made it. He loved it so much and kept going on about being sure to remember every step I did. Well here goes...</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <ol> 
  <li>I started with a 16oz piece of flat iron steak. Let it sit out for about 20 min+ to get the chill out of the meat.&nbsp;<br /></li>
  
  <li>I seasoned both sides with lemon pepper and salt. I then used a 12 oz can of chipoltle peppers in adobe sauce to spread over the steak.</li>
  
  <li>I heated my cast iron skillet up to high heat and let it just start to smoke. Then I drizzled the skillet with olive oil and put on the steak.</li>
  
  <li>I let it cook about 10 min. on each side to sear the outsides. Let it get nice and brown. When I flipped the steak over I poured some of the remaining chipoltle sauce over it.</li>
  
  <li>I heated my oven up to 350. Then I took a little water and poured it into the skillet to loosen up the bits in the pan and add some moisture back to the pan. I added some purple onion, roughly chopped.</li>
  
  <li>I put the skillet in the oven for about 15 min.</li>
  
  <li>Take the steak out and let the meat rest for 5 min before cutting into it. I then gathered all the chipoltle peppers and put them in a small bowl to serve on the side.</li>
   </ol>

  <p>We made tacos and had a yummy avocado salad with it. The salad was a delicious side...</p>
  
  <p>cut up 2 avocados and cover them with lime juice lemon pepper &amp; salt. place in a large salad bowl. i sliced a handful of cherry tomatoes in half and put them in bowl. i had some roasted corn from another night so i removed the kernels from the cob and tossed it in bowl. i diced a little purple onion up and tossed it in as well. salt &amp; pepper everything again and pour extra virgin olive oil over everything. squeeze 1 lime over bowl. mix it all up and add some lettuce then mix it again.&nbsp;</p>
