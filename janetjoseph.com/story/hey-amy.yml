  <p>This is for my bored sister committed to bed rest. She has a bun in the oven and we are trying to keep the little person there for a little longer! So Amy, stay in bed, keep your legs up, and DRINK A LOT OF WATER!!!!! I will be going home soon to be my usual annoying big sister help to her.</p>
  <p>I'll be cooking at her house as well, maybe she will find some recipes in here she likes! Like what I made tonight for dinner. My mouth is watering as I type dying to dive into it. (it's still in the oven!) I am making Lime Tomatillo Enchiladas w/ a brown rice pilaf. In the enchiladas I have put flat steak that I seared first with garlic salt and black pepper. Then thinly sliced up, rolled in a corn tortilla with cheese and topped with the tomatillo sauce. The rice is a mixture green bell peppers, onion, corn, dried oregano, and brown rice. I am going to mix a can of black beans in the rice to finish it. I made a batch of super margaritas and those are already starting to go to my head!(sorry Amy none for you yet!) Better go finish dinner. Miss you can't wait to see you. You better be in bed when I get there! -Love the big sis.</p>
