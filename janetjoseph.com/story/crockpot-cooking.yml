  <p>I am so not a crock-pot kind of girl, but I cooked up this idea in my cute little
  head and the finished product was quite delicious. It all started with a giant pack of stew meat I
  bought from Costco because I have been <em>craving</em> this Tex-Mex dish that
  you cannot get in California. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Carne Guisada&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t even try to order it in a mexican food place in California, because they look at you real funny!</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;ve made it before a long time ago but I
  always had the cheat mixers. Now a days I am a little better in the
  kitchen and I try, most times successfully, not to use cheat mixes.</p>
  
  <p>This is a pretty simple meal for those working peeps out there. It only
  took about 15 min to brown the meat before I headed off to work. This is where I pull out my
  crock pot I had bought for like $20 because I kept hearing about people
  cooking with them, but never could think of anything I could cook in it.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>I needed to brown the meat and I had a lot of it (even after
  freezing half) so I go for my brilliantly giant saute pan.&nbsp;My chef/best friend recommended I get this pan awhile back. It is so large and
  heavy I thought damn this thing is almost as big as me. Now she is a
  6ft giant, to her it is just a large roomy saute pan, to me it is like
  weight training. But it is one of those pans that I always go for
  because of it&rsquo;s brilliance in size.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Heat the brilliantly roomy pan up getting it pretty hot (medium high
  heat?) I&rsquo;m browning the meat so I want the outside layer to cook fast
  so it will be brown, not gray; that&rsquo;s why you need a hot pan.</li>
  
  <li>I
  seasoned the the meat with salt &amp; pepper. I drizzled olive oil in
  the pan getting a nice coating on the bottom. I threw some salt &amp;
  pepper in that too. <br /></li>
  
  <li>I start placing the meat in the pan making sure not
  to over crowd it. I then tossed in some garlic salt and cracked black
  pepper. Since the pan is really hot the meat has already started to
  brown. <br /></li>
  
  <li>Starting where I began putting the first pieces of meat in, I
  turned them over to brown the other sides. Some of the meat stuck a
  little to the bottom of the pan but I just gave it a little tug and all
  was fine. <br /></li>
  
  <li>The bottom of the pan was getting nice and browned itself
  which is a good thing because I am going to use that for my sauce when
  I get home.&nbsp;I had to brown the meat in 2 batches even with my giant pan
  because of the giant pieces of meat! You DO NOT want to over crowd the
  pan. Meaning, the meat should not overlap.</li>
  
  <li>I poured the browned meat into my crock pot, set it on low.
   Chopped up some carrots, yellow onion, and 3 garlic cloves and tossed
  those in. Put the lid on my crock pot and a lid on the saute pan to
  come back to after work.</li>
  
  <li>7 hrs later I come home and it smells delicious. Dan was making
  MexiMart&rsquo;s to go with our TexMex feast, which are so good (recipe for
  MexiMart&rsquo;s coming soon). Too good because I drank 3 and paid for it the next day! Anyway, I have a few sips of my cocktail and finish where I had left off in the
  morning. <br /></li>
  
  <li>I started with looking into my crock pot creation. The meat
  was sizzling away and had some good juices rocking in there. I began
  heating the giant saute pan I had set aside from this morning.
  (No, no one got sick because I used the same pan!) <br /></li>
  
  <li>I grabbed 2 red peppers
  gave &lsquo;em a rough chop, chopped up some more carrots, a purple onion, 2
  jalape&ntilde;os (from my own plant!) Heat the pan back up and drizzle with olive oil.
  Toss veggies in with all those yummy brownings, sprinkle
  with salt &amp; pepper and let them sweat it out for about 15min. <br /></li>
  
  <li>I
  then added 3 tbl spoons of flour &amp; butter coating all the veggies.
  I needed to de-glaze the pan now getting up all those flavorful bits. I
  grabbed the bottle of tequila Dan had left sitting right there on my
  cutting board and slowly poured some in, mixing as I poured. (<span style="font-style: italic;">make sure you lower the heat)</span><br /></li>
  
  <li>Not sure why I used tequila but it just seemed like a cool idea rather
  than going for my usual chicken stock, which can be used as well.<br /></li>
  
  <li>My bits came right up and the aroma in the kitchen was killer. The
  dudes in there where totally getting off! I think I used like half a
  bottle of tequila, good thing we had back up! I had a nice thick sauce
  now so I grabbed the crock pot bowl and poured all of that love into my
  sauce. The juices from the meat made it even more killer!</li>
  
  <li>I covered that and let let it simmer together while I made rice.&nbsp;I
  grabbed another pot and began toasting the rice. Just heat the pot and
  drizzle with olive oil and a few pats of butter. I use jasmine rice. Pour 1 cup of rice in the oil and mix it around for a few minutes until it becomes translucent. I added some
  salt &amp; pepper, dried oregano &amp; cayenne pepper to the pot. Then I poured
  the chicken stock in, about 1 1/2 cups. Stir it around and let it come to a boil then lower the heat cover and let simmer.</li>
  
  <li>Scoop the rice onto a plate and cover with JJ&rsquo;s Carne Guisada! It
  was sooooo damned good! A little bit spicy, a lot of flavor, and boy did
  my man <em>love</em> me!</li>
