  <p>I have been craving lately, some of that good 'ol southern cooking. Comfort food, you know, for those dark days we sometimes have. I've had a bit of a sad change in my life so I think I am going to make a delicious unhealthy meal for some comfort. I can only eat like this a few times a year, and I am going to have to be diligent about getting plenty of exercise for the rest of the week. Not that I am trying to be skinny, just healthy.</p>
  
  <p>I am thinking on the lines of some of my favorite foods my mom used to make. Comfort goes hand and hand with Mom! She made the BEST fried chicken, and mashed potatoes, and there is nothing like having a mom's food and love! I am going to make a spicy chicken fried pork chop with blue cheese mashed potatoes and something green. Maybe green beans.</p>
  
  <p>Now I need a grocery list: butterfly pork chops, russet potatoes, fresh green beans, blue cheese, purple onion, portabella mushrooms, buttermilk.</p>
  
  <p>You will also need: butter, milk, garlic, flour, chicken stock. I already have these things. I'll have a recipe after I've made it.</p>
