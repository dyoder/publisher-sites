  <p>There is nothing like a big bowl of hearty soup when you feel crappy. I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate canned soup. When I'm feeling under the weather, I don't really feel like cooking either. What I do is try to keep key ingredients in my kitchen to make a soup easily and quickly. For instance, if you keep either boxed or homemade chicken stock on hand all the time, you have your base. Onion, garlic, carrots, bell peppers, and you have your vegetables. I keep these veggies on hand because I use them for so many different recipes. Sausage has a long shelf life and you can also freeze it, so I like to keep different kinds of sausage around as well. They are perfect for soups too. Now you have a hearty soup that will be easy to throw together. But I don't just like soup when I'm sick, I think of it as a comfort food as well. Especially on a cold rainy day. For this soup what I happened to have in the fridge was the perfect&nbsp;ensemble&nbsp;for a rich, smokey flavored, spicy soup.</p>
  
  <p>Here's how it all came together...</p>
  
  <p>Dan had smoked some delicious tri-tip ribs a few nights ago on his grill, and sent some leftovers home with me. I had been trying to think of something different to make out of it. I really wanted soup and had all this smokey flavored meat and thought, hey this could be good! I also had saved the bones of a&nbsp;rotisserie&nbsp;chicken I bought the other day from the store to make chicken stock with. It was a chipoltle flavored chicken. I love those&nbsp;rotisserie&nbsp;chickens because after a day full of errands and a trip to the store, the last thing I want to do is spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I just want to unload the grocery's and eat! The chicken is hot and juicy and ready to go. I usually make some brown rice and mix black beans in that, heat up corn tortillas, and dinner is ready! But back to the soup...&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>cover the chicken bones with water and set over medium high heat. about 8 cups.</li>
  
  <li>to that add; top and bottom of 2 onions, rough chop a few carrots skin tops and all, (keep 2-3 carrot for the soup, but you can use the top and tips of those for the stock) 4-5 garlic cloves. you do not have to peel or remove skin off any of these veggies because we are going to strain it all out. if you have celery use it, i didn't. pour in a palm full of whole peppercorns, and salt. i threw in a couple of bay leaves too.</li>
  
  <li>let it come to a boil, then lower the heat a little and let it cook.</li>
  
  <li>heat a big soup pot over medium high heat and coat with olive oil. chop the rest of the onion up into nice square sized pieces, toss into the pot, crack some black pepper into pot, and sprinkle with salt. give a mix.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>cut the carrots in half length wise, chop those up and add to the onions.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>chop up a red bell pepper and add to the pot as well. take the tri-tip ribs and cut it up into nice bite size pieces (i had 3 ribs), add all the meat to the pot and mix it all together. turn down the heat to medium.</li>
  
  <li>time to strain the chicken stock. i usually remove the chicken bones with a big strainer spoon, then pour the stock through a strainer sitting in a big bowl. remove the strainer, and pour the stock into the soup pot.&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li>i chopped up 2 small&nbsp;zucchinis&nbsp;and a grilled sausage link to add to the soup. i did that last because i didn't want the&nbsp;zucchini&nbsp;to get mushy and the sausage is already cooked enough.</li>
  
  <li>let it come to a light boil, then let it simmer covered for 20-45 min. i had some boxed stock that i added to keep it thinned, i think i added about 2 cups because i let it simmer for about 45 min.</li>
  
  <li>while the soup is simmering i boiled some pasta to serve in the soup. i used whole wheat penne pasta, but use whatever you have.</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>My finished soup was so full of flavor and really quite delicious. It had a nice smokey flavor from the smoked tri-tip, and the meat, wow! and the meat was so tender and juicy. The sausage was a&nbsp;Louisiana&nbsp;spicy sausage so it added a nice kick to the soup. I was pretty impressed with myself.</p>

summary: I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate canned soup.
