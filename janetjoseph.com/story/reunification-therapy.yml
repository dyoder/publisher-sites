  <p>After 2 years of not seeing Maia, Charlie finally makes his first attempt and flies to Ca. Not because he's chosen to make the first step but because we had a court hearing.</p>
  <p>The court issued him 3 sessions of reunifcation therapy in Los Angeles. Typical to form for Charlie, he calls me from the airport and asks me to see about rescheduling the first session. I'm thinking to myself, really?! You haven't even left Ca. and your already trying to reschedule! The best part is that he actually thinks I'm suppose to call MY lawyer and let him know Charlie needs to cancel. No IDIOT! You call and cancel!</p>
  <p>No wait the best part is, he has to cancel because he's in a wedding that weekend. So typical of him to choose his friend over making things right with his kid. It was always his friends, his job, or that he was too messed up on drugs &amp; alcohol to take care of her. Now he can't even make it to his reunification therapy because he's in a wedding! He tells me how much it's killing him inside not being able to see Maia, then says, but I can't make the therapy session. NOTHING has changed!</p>
