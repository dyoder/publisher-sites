  <p>We did a little fundraiser bake sale after school for Maia's Science Camp the other day. The idea is to raise money to help the kids pay for the trip. I thought it would be fun for her and her friends to sell the goods to kids after school since kids are always asking for a snack as soon as they get out!&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Now I made some really delicious snacks and I'm going to share some of my creations here on my blog, but, I just have to say how shocked I was by what we sold the most of. Another one of the parents had brought juices and other little packaged snacks which was great. The only problem was the kids and parents all went for the packaged snacks! I would say it was because they didn't want all the sugar, but they bought sugared juices and donuts and things. We did have healthy snacks like carrots, mini bananas, and these chips called pirate booty's. The pirate booty's went quickest, but they were the least cost effective. Now call me old fashioned but isn't a bake sale supposed to be baked goods? Maybe that you bake yourself? Needless to say my things sold the least and it wasn't because they were inedible. In my opinion it was because everybody is so use to quick and easy items. Dan pointed out it also could be parents don't want to buy things from people they don't know. I am in denial about that! Besides they buy things from people they don't know all the time. Do they go and inspect all those factories? I think not!</p>
  
  <p>Next time I am going to print out little ingredient stickers for my baked goods. This way kids and parents can see the wholesome goodness in my down home baked goods.</p>
  
  <p>For the sale I made banana bread, cheese bread, oatmeal crisp cookies, and popcorn trail mix. Since I live in California I get to take advantage of all the wonderful farmer's markets so my bananas were&nbsp;organic. The oatmeal I used for the crisps was raw steel oats. None of this instant quaker shit. My popcorn is popped on a stove in a canola/olive oil mix, and I use real, organic sugar. No additives. No corn syrup. Just pure home-made goodness!</p>
