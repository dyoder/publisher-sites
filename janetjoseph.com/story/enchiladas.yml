  <p>I updated this recipe using carne asada instead of ground beef. This is a thin flat steak, very delicious. What to do... Dust asada with garlic salt, cracked black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Let it come to room temperature. heat up a skillet on high heat, (or a grill) drizzle skillet with olive oil and sear the steak on both sides for about 3 min each side. You want it a little rare because you are going to cook it more in an oven. Remove it from any heat, squeeze some lime juice over it, let it rest and go back to preparing your tortillas. When you are ready to roll the enchiladas, slice the asada into thin strips against the grain.</p>
