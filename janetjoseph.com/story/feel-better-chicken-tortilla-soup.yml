  <ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">i started with seasoning some chicken tenders in lemon pepper seasoning. set aside in fridge.<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">i then got my vegetables together. i used asparagus, carrot, celery, jalapeno, garlic, green onion. i used what i happen to have around. chop all the veggies up into bite size pieces.&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">next i heated up my sauce pot over medium high heat. let the pan get hot and then place the chicken in it. let chicken cook for about 5 min each side until it is a nice golden brown on the out sides. remove chicken onto a cutting board.&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">now drizzle pot with olive oil and toss in veggies, salt &amp; pepper.<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">cut chicken into bite size pieces and put back into the pot.&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">i then sprinkled in a small pinch of dried oregano and a few dashes of hot sauce. mix it all up.<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">pour chicken stock&nbsp;&nbsp;into pot. enough to cover chicken and veggies. you can lower the heat to medium now.<br /></span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">cut up corn tortilla into bite size pieces and add it to the pot. i finished this off with some chopped cilantro, a little lime zest &amp; juice. i served soup in an oversized mug and drank and slurped my way to feeling better!<br /></span></li>
  
  </ul>

  <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">i felt really crapy when i made this soup and wanted something refreshing and hearty. my throat was sore and my sinuses felt like they were dried out. this soup helped sooo much! the warmth form the soup soothed my throat and the spiciness kicked in those sinus for instant relief from the dryness. I had to keep my tissues close! ;)</p>
