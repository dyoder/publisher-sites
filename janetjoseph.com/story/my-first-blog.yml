  <p>I always gave my boyfriend such a hard time about blogs and all the crap people would write, but here I am Eating my words as usual doing what I said I&rsquo;d never do! The key word here Eating! We love to do it in our household and I come from a long line of &ldquo;Foodies&rdquo;(meaning people who love to eat). My first recipe for my first blog will be Fresh Tomato Pasta w/ Meat. A favorite in our house! Tomatoes are one of those super foods packed full of good stuff like vitamin C, vitamin A and antitoxidants. This is a simple but delicious meal.<br /> Fresh Tomato Sauce Over Pasta Recipe&hellip;</p>
  
  <p>Ingredients: tomatoes, onion, garlic, ground beef, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt &amp; ground pepper, olive oil, bay leaves</p>
  
  <p>Tomato Sauce;<br /> 1.	Heat stock pot over medium heat.</p>
  
  <p>2.	Dice 1/2 of white onion, pour olive oil in pot (til it covers the bottom) throw in onion. add a few pinches of salt &amp; ground pepper let them carmalize</p>
  
  <p>3.	Quarter 11-13 roma tomatoes. set aside</p>
  
  <p>4.	Add red pepper flakes, &amp; italian seasoning into the pot, stir, add 1lb. ground beef, season with salt &amp; pepper, let brown.</p>
  
  <p>5.	Smash 3 cloves of garlic, roughly chop rest of onion, place tomato&rsquo;s, garlic, onion, &amp; a few pinches of salt &amp; pepper in blender, set blender to chop and pulse chop until ingredients are mixed and chopped up.</p>
  
  <p>6.	Pour tomato mix in pot, add 2 bay leaves, let sauce come to a boil, and then simmer for about an hour. (no lid)</p>
  
  <p>Tips:<br /> Tomatoes are watery so you have to let the water cook out, the longer you simmer the better the flavor. You can speed up cooking by cooking on a higher heat but you have to keep an eye on it. If you need to thicken the sauce add a can of plain tomato sauce. To thin it add chicken stock. If you ever have red wine left over it&rsquo;s alway nice to cook it in the sauce. Just add it after you browned your meat.</p>
  
  <p>Pasta:<br /> 1.	Bring water to a boil in a large pot.<br /> 2.	Salt water and add angel hair pasta, (or your favorite kind of pasta)<br /> 3.	Strain pasta and pour into a large serving dish.<br /> 4.	Grate some mozzerella cheese &amp; chop some fresh basil for garnish.</p>
  
  <p>Pour sauce over pasta &amp; mix together, sprinkle cheese over top, finish with fresh basil.</p>
