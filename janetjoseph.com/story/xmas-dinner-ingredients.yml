  <p>I&rsquo;ve taken a bit of a hiatus on cooking. I just haven&rsquo;t been inspired lately. Guess I&rsquo;m in one of my dark cloud moods (as my guy calls them!) I want to make a super delicious xmas dinner and  I love cooking around holidays but I am so uninspired!</p>
  
  <p>I can&rsquo;t quite figure out what my problem is, other than my job. I&rsquo;m so sick of this job I have. I mean I&rsquo;ve been doing it since I was 18 and it was fine back then but now it sux. I&rsquo;m in the nail business. I&rsquo;m a manicurist and back in &lsquo;92 it was a great way to make cash. Now I feel like I work harder for the same amount of money I made 15 years ago thanks to all the asian shops (chop shops as I like to call them).</p>
  
  <p>Of course my living expenses are not like they were even 5 years ago so I&rsquo;m basically stuck in a dead end job. I probably should have taken my mom&rsquo;s advice and worked a state job, at least then I could afford health insurance! No way I could do that kind of job though. I do like what I do when I have some of my more preferred clients, but all the awful people in between just makes me want to stab some of the bitches with my nippers which of course would be bad for business!</p>
  
  <p>Okay enough whining, I&rsquo;ve come up some ingredients and I am beginning to feel excited about putting them all together. Here they are&hellip;</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>beef tenderloin</li>
  
  <li>cranberries</li>
  
  <li>ginger</li>
  
  <li>green beans</li>
  
  <li>crimini mushrooms</li>
  
  <li>butternut squash  <br /></li>
  
  <li>balsalmic vinegar <br /></li>
  
  <li>apples</li>
  
  <li>sage</li>
  
  <li>lavender</li>
  
  <li>thyme <br /></li>
  
  <li>champagne! </li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>I think I am going to sear the tenderloin let it rest and then slice it length wise open. Then I plan on stuffing it with corn bread stuffing and finishing it in the oven.  Just not sure what  I am going to put in the stuffing.</p>
  
  <p>I love figs and want to use them but I haven&rsquo;t figured out where yet. Either in the stuffing or in the green beans. The cranberries would be good in the green beans or the stuffing too. Or, I could make a cranberry ginger chutney for a sauce to put on the tenderloin! The stuffing could be apples, figs and my herbs.</p>
