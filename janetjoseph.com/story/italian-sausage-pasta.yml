  <p>I kept this pretty basic with just a few key ingredients to make this entree delicious. Here is what you will need...</p>
  <p>mild italian sausage, roma tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, nutmeg, basil olive oil, angel hair pasta, fresh grated parmesan cheese.</p>
  <p><ol>
  <li>boil water for the pasta</li>
  <li>heat a pan over medium high heat and brown the sausage. squeeze sausage out of casing if comes in one. break up into pieces while it is browning. once meat is almost all browned add in a few pinches of red pepper flakes (depending how spicy you prefer) and a few pinches of nutmeg. turn heat down to medium</li>
  <li>quarter the tomatoes and place into food processor. smash garlic cloves, peel skin off and place in food processor. give it a quick chop and pour into the pan with the sausage. season with salt &amp; pepper. (you'll need about 6 tomatoes for 2 servings)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>once water for pasta comes to a boil add salt to water and add pasta. let cook until desired tenderness. (angel hair takes the least amount of time to cook)</li>
  <li>using tongs take the pasta out of the pasta water and add to the italian sausage and tomato sauce pan. once all the pasta is out drizzle basil olive oil over pasta and season with salt &amp; pepper. pour everything into a big bowl and mix it all up.</li>
  <li>grade fresh parmesan cheese over top and serve!</li>
